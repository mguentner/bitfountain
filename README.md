experimental data transceiver using QR codes

## Instructions

Open the application on one device and select `Transmitter`. Then select a file that you want
to transmit to another device.
Please be aware that currently only max. ~20 KiB work in an acceptable timeframe.

Then, open the same app on another device and select `Receiver`. Allow access to your camera
and point it to the QR codes generated by the `Transmitter`.
A file-download dialog will open once the transmission has been completed.

## Tips

- Make sure the camera keeps the other screen in focus, the picture needs to be sharp
- Center the QR code in the image, leave some space to all sides
- It may take some time until the `Receiver` reads the first descriptor slice. Only then you will see the file information.

## Background

Since the `Transmitter` does not know what parts of the file the `Receiver` already has received, [Luby Transform Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby_transform_code) are used in contrast to naive looping.

  research about Luby Codes and his project [txqr](https://github.com/divan/txqr) that uses `gomobile`.
- https://github.com/google/gofountain is a great go package than links to useful papers in the comments. Worth a read!

## Non-Upstream Software used

- react-use-qrcode: This project uses a modified version of https://github.com/pocesar/react-use-qrcode, (`src/useQrCode.ts` & `src/workers/qrcode.worker`).
- `File` / `Blob` mocks: `src/test/file/*` is a modified version copied from https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom
- `src/FileUtils.ts` contains a port of https://github.com/google/gofountain/blob/master/block.go
